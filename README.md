# sauce_quickstart

I started with the Sauce Labs archetype, then combined the two methods I needed from exporting the Selenium IDE test case.

I also modified the authentication so that my username and API key weren't in the source code. 
Instead, I just set them as environment variables, SAUCE_USERNAME and SAUCE_API_KEY.
